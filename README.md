# Graph Coloring
Find an n-coloring of a graph using multithread and/or MPI ðŸ¤¨

### Lab 9 - Chaos
#### Due: week 14
#### Requirement
Each student or team of 2 students will take one project. It is ok to take a theme that is not listed below (but check with the lab advisor before starting).

Each project will have 2 implementations: one with "regular" threads or tasks/futures, and one distributed (possibly, but not required, using MPI).

The documentation will describe:
- the algorithms,
- synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
- the performance measurements
